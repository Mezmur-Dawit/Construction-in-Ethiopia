        <p>Even though Ethiopia has itâ€™s own several ancient civilisations, from the 60s there is a great influence by the international style of architectural design. Because of these, every building is reduced to plain vertical and horizontal lines of concrete blocks, which being unimpressive and ugly, are a menace to the society and a cause of environmental degradation. They are also a cause of a complete break to traditional values and cultural patterns. Apart from that, because of the international style influence, the country can not relate itself with tradition while, we have not yet been to able satisfy the basic housing needs of our people even with the modern solutions. But I think, it is very important to learn from mistakes done on built housing blocks that were implemented with out thorough study of function. And it is important to encourage construction of buildings with local materials and of course with consideration of functional requirements and proper management.
