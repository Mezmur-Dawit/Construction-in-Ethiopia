            <p>even though the government and the people are deeply involved and have started reconstructing the country, the housing construction activities are limited.  As such this sector has not yet developed General recommendations could however be proposed with respect to housing, design of building and management of construction. One of the priorities would be to develop public and privet sector institutions that can contribute to this end. Institutional capacity needs to be strengthened through continuos training of the existing manpower and impute of qualified professionals. Programs for creating a national capacity in management of construction need to be introduction. Special emphasis should be put on strengthening the capacity of small and medium scale contractors. Labour force in rural areas must be utilised by labour intensive method of construction. Housing policy, planing legislation and building codes should aim at health, safety and preservation of the environment </p>
