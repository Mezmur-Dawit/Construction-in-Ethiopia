    <p>  The design process The design process in building design enterprise (BDE) and other consultants of the design of buildings in the formal sector is a co-operative effort between the client and various consultants. The client provides a set of requirements and constraints that the consultants attempt satisfy during the design process. To satisfy the client brief, a design team is constituted which consist of all the consultants. The team in most cases is headed by the architect or by the consultant in recent times. The consultant is appointed by the client and takes care of the client’s interests according to the general condition of construction. The contributions of each consultant in the design process can be summarised as follows:  
        • Brief Stage Client provides the design brief that consists of the requirements and constraints to the design team. • Sketch Design Stage Architect prepares a preliminary sketch to satisfy the designs brief and possibly provides alternative proposal. Quantity surveyor prepares preliminary cost estimates based on the Architect’s design sketch. Quantity surveyor provides the initial cost plan that forms the basis of cost control and budgeting. Client approves sketch and cost estimates.  • Scheme Design Stage Architect designs to a greater detail to meet the submission requirements of the local authority. Quantity surveyor undertakes various costs, checks and ensures that the budget is not exceeded. Architect provides scheme designs to the civil (structural), mechanical and electrical engineers for the engineering design of the project. Archi
        tect submits scheme design for approval to the local authority. • Detail Design Stage Architects proceed to detail design the elements and components of various spaces and prepares specification for the project. Quantity surveyor prepares bills of quantities and final cost check. Engineers finalise their drawings and specifications.</p>
