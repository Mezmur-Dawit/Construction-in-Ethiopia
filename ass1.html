            Building and financing within the country:  There are various forms of financing building projects in Ethiopia. Depending on the type and the nature of the project. To minimise the housing problem in the country, especially in densely populated cities, the government as well as privet owners are constructing many new rental apartments. For the private sector, there is a special loan arrangement from housing and saving bank of Ethiopia.
        </p>
    To To minimise the housing problem and having owned house each person, the agricultural and industrial development bank of Ethiopia is giving loans for house builders. To be eligible to get a loan from the bank, it is a requirement that the client should manage to have at least 35% of the total estimated cost of the building. 
    <p>Then he could obtain the rest 65% from the respective banks. The combined interest per year is 10.5% since the government through the country owns land. It should be noted that it could be obtained from the government by leasing. Usually the lease will last for about 99 years. But due to shorter loan term and the higher interest value, very few have used the opportunity, in addition the average incomes of the middle class are too low to cover the payment of their loans to the banks regularly. Therefore, the main problems encountered by the sector should be clearly identified and studied.

            Budget and budget control  Cost estimates are prepared at end of the design stage to establish the project budget. Consultant Quantity Surveyor appointed undertakes preparations of the cost estimates of the project by the client. The Quantity Surveyor uses several methods to prepare cost estimates depending on type of project. This estimate is normally used as a yardstick for cost control during design, tendering and Construction process. The main objective for establishing a cost estimate is to be used as a basis for cost control during execution of the construction project, to establish target budget for the given project, to determine the scope of the project and to establish cash flow and cost forecasting.
